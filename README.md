# PictureFrame

It's a pretty simple concept: ChatGPT generates a prompt for Leonardo.AI, which in turn creates a painting or graphic that can be shown on a picture frame. I have it running on an hourly cron job.

As this script destroys the image on the server, and overwrites the file on the filesystem, this means I only have an hour to spend with the art piece before it's gone forever.

In the age of generated art, this is a way for me to add value to it.
